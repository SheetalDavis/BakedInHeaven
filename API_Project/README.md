# API_Project
This project is to create a website that sells baked goodies online. As part of the first phase, a website for the bakery which would showcase the items available and to share the contact details of the shop will be created. Interested customers can get in touch to order items which can be picked up from the shop later. 
## General Info
This repository contains list of tables, their relationships, constraints, and indices. Also an ER diagram representing the relationships.
